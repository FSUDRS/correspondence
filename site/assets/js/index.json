The noise of all the transformation in the universe? It is the hour of meditation, The hour to take the pulse of mankind/humankind The fateful hour to turn one page of life The hour to count oneself for the new battle. NON, I will claim no precedence And even so I am the old compost Who gives color and scent to the rose I raise up for you, a corner of sail, a piece of sky I speak well of sail and sky… My language is not always a human language It rolls up neither gold nor diamond, It casts in the whirlwind and catches the hand of a neighbor. Scapegoat emissary Burned to all easters, I am again the stake in the betting house. I entertain the fools in public places. Never lower the cross My brothers dispersed In the great day of colors and feasts, Only one hand dries the tears Of each who pay for Cham and Canaan I always claim the colors of the pirate of the islands But allow the old merchants the tibia and the skull I also know hunger and cold and the weight of injustice. GOD, I do not ask the life for a continent, I would not have understood the lesson. MANKIND Pushed in the greatness of pain, I neither demand of you the supremacy of one color Or of one people… Always pull for the world I have played with the rats in solitary confinement, Trembled in the days pricked by bayonets. I have tended to all my wagers, those of my mother, those of my father, those of my children, those of my friends. All, to all the bad weather and to all the rancor all the cheeks which are mine So that finally the day rises and the canons fall silent. I get out of the hell on earth, of all the nights that are not Your nights Purified, Virgin, angelic, I ask Joseph sold to the Egyptians, The one that will burn tomorrow at Easter When the earth will need to connect to the sky. NON! I ask neither the bread nor the wine for a continent I no longer demand the price of my blood over the greenery and the oceans, I am of those who don’t know how to read or write of those who don’t have memory and don’t inscribe their hatred in the notches of time, of those who don’t measure their wisdom by the size of the parchment. But know how to read the sun and the moon and the stars. Fireflies in the new shadows We are the fools of today and not of the century. GOD, the bread and the wine, You have never resumed to cradle my worries my sleeplessness never have been swaddling clothes. I know that, those who are in Your name, are the typhoon blowing over my life who have made of me The stag that it kills in the daily music But… HERE WE ARE standing at the threshold of the new year each with his anxieties and his dreams. In my dizziness, I ask that the islands marry the islands, the fortresses to fortresses and frontiers to frontiers; that each go out over the square of the cathedral and sings with the other, facing those of the right and those of the left of east and of west, with the angels and the Devils, All go out from the hand of God, The Great song of Mankind over the earth.

I only have hunger and thirst my sleeplessness and my nightmares; my candor dragging over the brambles in the rock garden/stony ground. I drew the water from the fountain to water the flowers. A woman came and broke my gourd; Picked up in the sand, a small ribbon of velvet A passer-by snatched it from my hands Mary, it is good your month, I know this, the month of grades and of fervor. I wanted to adorn myself of my last old clothes to come pray at your altar, but the men have torn me in pieces; to gather the dawn to tend to my misery, but the men have worn out their eyes. I wanted to laugh, laugh when the same, But the men came back and gagged me. They gagged me, Mary. But they haven’t killed my fervor. [I] Have bypassed the two of men with sabres keeping guard at the entrance to the temple, I sensed antagonism around me, the eyes of the faithful in their Sunday best and covered in medals. In the month of graces and of fervor, born and innocent, I have nothing to offer, Mary only my prayer of beggars and of the one a tramp all the century. It is good your month, Mary the month of graces and flowers And only have my hunger and my thirst my sleeplessness and my nightmares.

No warehouse holds them. I carry neither gold nor diamond to set (in) the crowns nor the fine muslin to clothe the highness, But some songs, some dances, some dreams I sow in the country of sun where the stars are eyes and ears. And I give account of my riches to all the ticket takers, to all the stages Goré, Dakar, Sor Allegro in the concert of memories.
